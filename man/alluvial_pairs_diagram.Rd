\title{Create alluvial diagrams for a classified raster with 2 or more layers.}
\usage{
alluvial_pairs_diagram(raster, lookup, naValue = NA, a_unit = "px")
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{A \code{SpatRaster} object containing multiple raster layers. The function
will compare transitions between consecutive layers.}

\item{lookup}{A data frame or list with at least three columns:
- The first column: Class names (factor levels),
- The second column: Class identifiers (factors),
- The third column: Color mapping for each class.}

\item{naValue}{A value to replace any \code{NA} or \code{NaN} values in the raster layers
(default is \code{NA}).}

\item{a_unit}{A string indicating the units for the area label (default is "px").}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects, each representing an alluvial diagram for the
transition between two consecutive raster layers.
}
\description{
This function analyzes land cover change between the categorized layers of a SpatRaster
object using \code{terra}and visualizes from-to relations using \code{ggalluvial} diagrams.
}
\details{
The function is intended for visualizing land cover change analysis.
For better readability the layers should have timestamps, these can be set
with terra::time().

This sets arbitrary timestamps if they are not present. It also ensures that the raster layers
are categorized using the provided lookup table, which assigns class names, identifiers,
and colors to each raster class.

The function works by iterating through consecutive raster layers, computing
a crosstabulation of the class transitions between layers, and then plotting
the resulting transitions using the \code{ggalluvial} package. The resulting plots
are returned as a list of \code{ggplot} objects.
